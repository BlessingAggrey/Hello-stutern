# Hello-stutern
My first repository on GitHub.
My name is Blessing DeNwigwe-Aggrey. I'm a medical student.
I'm looking to gain some other skills like being a techie.
I love to read, go to the beach and get some sand on my feet, I also love to hang out with friends on weekends.
I'm a Christian and a firm believer of the word of God.
